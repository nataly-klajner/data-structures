# Assignment 4

## Part 1 - uploaded images

## Part 2 - install.js

On this file I used the starter code, changing the info for my credentials, to create the table where the data for the meetings of zone 04 would be inserted.

To verify that the code worked I tried running it again, where an error message stated that the table already existed, proving it worked.

The name of the table is aalocations, and its contents are (address varchar(100), lat double precision, long double precision).

## Parte 3 - run.js 

On this file I worked on the starter code to insert the meetings data I had stored in a json file on assignment 3.

Aside for changing the credentials, I changed where it was written "lng" to "lon", which was how I had longitude written on my file.
