# Assignment 5

## Part 1
In the sketches uploaded to week5 folder I tried to show my thoughts on how my entries for this assignments would be. 
As they are thoughts that cross my mind there was no way to display them in a tabular way, for each entry has its own piece of information that was important for me at that moment. 

## Part 2
The code that was written uses a variable myItem to store the objects that contains strings for each entry. 
With dynamodb.putItem the new item is being stored in the Dear Diary table created. 
The last part of the code tells the console to log a success phrase.

## Part 3
For each entry the information was written in objetcs inside var myItem. As the dynamodb.putItem always calls for the same variable, for each new one that I wrote I commented out the previous entry.
